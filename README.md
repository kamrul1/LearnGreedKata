# GREED KATA

Source of Exercise: https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/Greed.md

## Inital Thoughts

Not very easy to understand the Kata instructions, as did not make logic sense on how they are scoring it.

Wikipedia has a easier to understand rule for the game called [Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle) which is the 
same game.

|Dice Combination   | Score |
|---                |---    |
|Each 1             |100    |
|Each 5             |50     |
|Three 1s           |1000   |
|Three 2s           |200    |
|Three 3s	        |300    |
|Three 4s	        |400    |
|Three 5s	        |500    |
|Three 6s	        |600    |

   
## Approach tried first         
- Counts 1 - 6 six using above rules,
  - code refactoring after above gets messy.
  - made mistake in thinkly initally six 1s are allowed to score 1000, but not the case
 - Count other case examples given
